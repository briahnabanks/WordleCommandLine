# Wordle Command Line Game
A backend code that allows you to play a mimic of the classic New York Times "Wordle" game.


## Story            
For our third challenge in the Apple Developer Acadamy Detroit, we were instructed to create a classic game using no UI, only Command Line Interface. 

I chose to do Wordle, as it is a game that I already play fairly often. This was my first project creating logic in code, making it challenging but also rewarding to complete.

## Features
The command line loads instructing the user to guesa a five letter word. After a guess is entered, the terminal tells you if you have guessed the word correctly or not. If correct, a congratulations message is prompted. If incorrect,the code will return telling you the correct letters guessed, as well as if their placement is correct or not. A word bank is kept as well upon each try, so that the user can keep track of the words they have used.

You are allowed five tries to guess the correct word before the game ends. When the game ends, the CLI will tell you the correct word. 

## Lessons Learned
Being my first coding project, I learned alot with this code. I learned Swift incantracies, like the importance of arrays, functions, and more. This code ultimately built my confidence as a coder, and I thouroughly enjoyed coding without physical UI to look at. I had to think in a new way to figure out strictly logic. 

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the mentors in the Academy. They pushed me alot and were able to help me alot during this challenge.
